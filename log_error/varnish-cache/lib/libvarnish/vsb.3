.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm vsb
family of functions allows one to safely allocate, construct and
release bounded null-terminated strings in kernel space.
Instead of arrays of characters, these functions operate on structures
called
.Fa vsbs ,
defined in
.In sys/vsb.h .
.Pp
The
.Fn vsb_new
function initializes the
.Fa vsb
pointed to by its first argument.
If that pointer is
.Dv NULL ,
.Fn vsb_new
allocates a
.Vt struct vsb
using
.Xr malloc 9 .
The
.Fa buf
argument is a pointer to a buffer in which to store the actual string;
if it is
.Dv NULL ,
.Fn vsb_new
will allocate one using
.Xr malloc 9 .
The
.Fa length
is the initial size of the storage buffer.
The fourth argument,
.Fa flags ,
may be comprised of the following flags:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv VSB_AUTOEXTEND"
.It Dv VSB_FIXEDLEN
The storage buffer is fixed at its initial size.
Attempting to extend the vsb beyond this size results in an overflow condition.
.It Dv VSB_AUTOEXTEND
This indicates that the storage buffer may be extended as necessary, so long
as resources allow, to hold additional data.
.El
.Pp
Note that if
.Fa buf
is not
.Dv NULL ,
it must point to an array of at least
.Fa length
characters.
The result of accessing that array directly while it is in use by the
vsb is undefined.
.Pp
The
.Fn vsb_delete
function clears the
.Fa vsb
and frees any memory allocated for it.
There must be a call to
.Fn vsb_delete
for every call to
.Fn vsb_new .
Any attempt to access the vsb after it has been deleted will fail.
.Pp
The
.Fn vsb_clear
function invalidates the contents of the
.Fa vsb
and resets its position to zero.
.Pp
The
.Fn vsb_setpos
function sets the
.Fa vsb Ns 's
end position to
.Fa pos ,
which is a value between zero and one less than the size of the
storage buffer.
This effectively truncates the vsb at the new position.
.Pp
The
.Fn vsb_bcat
function appends the first
.Fa len
bytes from the buffer
.Fa buf
to the
.Fa vsb .
.Pp
The
.Fn vsb_bcpy
function replaces the contents of the
.Fa vsb
with the first
.Fa len
bytes from the buffer
.Fa buf .
.Pp
The
.Fn vsb_cat
function appends the NUL-terminated string
.Fa str
to the
.Fa vsb
at the current position.
.Pp
The
.Fn vsb_cpy
function replaces the contents of the
.Fa vsb
with those of the NUL-terminated string
.Fa str .
This is equivalent to calling
.Fn vsb_cat
with a fresh
.Fa vsb
or one which position has been reset to zero with
.Fn vsb_clear
or
.Fn vsb_setpos .
.Pp
The
.Fn vsb_printf
function formats its arguments according to the format string pointed
to by
.Fa fmt
and appends the resulting string to the
.Fa vsb
at the current position.
.Pp
The
.Fn vsb_vprintf
function behaves the same as
.Fn vsb_printf
except that the arguments are obtained from the variable-length argument list
.Fa ap .
.Pp
The
.Fn vsb_putc
function appends the character
.Fa c
to the
.Fa vsb
at the current position.
.Pp
The
.Fn vsb_trim
function removes trailing whitespace from the
.Fa vsb .
.Pp
The
.Fn vsb_overflowed
function returns a non-zero value if the
.Fa vsb
overflowed.
.Pp
The
.Fn vsb_finish
function null-terminates the
.Fa vsb
and marks it as finished, which means that it may no longer be
modified using
.Fn vsb_setpos ,
.Fn vsb_cat ,
.Fn vsb_cpy ,
.Fn vsb_printf
or
.Fn vsb_putc .
.Pp
The
.Fn vsb_data
and
.Fn vsb_len
functions return the actual string and its length, respectively;
.Fn vsb_data
only works on a finished
.Fa vsb .
.Fn vsb_done
returns non-zero if the vsb is finished.
.Sh NOTES
If an operation caused an
.Fa vsb
to overflow, most subsequent operations on it will fail until the
.Fa vsb
is finished using
.Fn vsb_finish
or reset using
.Fn vsb_clear ,
or its position is reset to a value between 0 and one less than the
size of its storage buffer using
.Fn vsb_setpos ,
or it is reinitialized to a sufficiently short string using
.Fn vsb_cpy .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn vsb_new
returns
.Dv NULL
if it failed to allocate a storage buffer, and a pointer to the new
.Fa vsb
otherwise.
.Pp
.Fn vsb_setpos
returns \-1 if
.Fa pos
was invalid, and zero otherwise.
.Pp
.Fn vsb_cat ,
.Fn vsb_cpy ,
.Fn vsb_printf ,
.Fn vsb_putc ,
and
.Fn vsb_trim
all return \-1 if the buffer overflowed, and zero otherwise.
.Pp
.Fn vsb_overflowed
returns a non-zero value if the buffer overflowed, and zero otherwise.
.Pp
.Fn vsb_data
and
.Fn vsb_len
return
.Dv NULL
and \-1, respectively, if the buffer overflowed.
