/*--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TTL and Age calculation in Varnish
 *
 * RFC2616 has a lot to say about how caches should calculate the TTL
 * and expiry times of objects, but it sort of misses the case that
 * applies to Varnish:  the server-side cache.
 *
 * A normal cache, shared or single-client, has no symbiotic relationship
 * with the server, and therefore must take a very defensive attitude
 * if the Data/Expiry/Age/max-age data does not make sense.  Overall
 * the policy described in section 13 of RFC 2616 results in no caching
 * happening on the first little sign of trouble.
 *
 * Varnish on the other hand tries to offload as many transactions from
 * the backend as possible, and therefore just passing through everything
 * if there is a clock-skew between backend and Varnish is not a workable
 * choice.
 *
 * Varnish implements a policy which is RFC2616 compliant when there
 * is no clockskew, and falls as gracefully as possible otherwise.
 * Our "clockless cache" model is syntehsized from the bits of RFC2616
 * that talks about how a cache should react to a clockless origin server,
 * and more or less uses the inverse logic for the opposite relationship.
