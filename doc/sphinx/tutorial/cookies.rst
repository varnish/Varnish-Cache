Cookies
-------

Varnish will, in the default configuration, not cache a object coming
from the backend with a Set-Cookie header present. Also, if the client
sends a Cookie header, Varnish will bypass the cache and go directly to
the backend.

This can be overly conservative. A lot of sites use Google Analytics
(GA) to analyze their traffic. GA sets a cookie to track you. This
cookie is used by the client side javascript and is therefore of no
interest to the server. 

Cookies from the client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a lot of web application it makes sense to completely disregard the
cookies unless you are accessing a special part of the web site. This
VCL snippet in vcl_recv will disregard cookies unless you are
accessing /admin/::

  if ( !( req.url ~ ^/admin/) ) {
    unset req.http.Cookie;
  }

Quite simple. If, however, you need to do something more complicated,
like removing one out of several cookies, things get
difficult. Unfortunately Varnish doesn't have good tools for
manipulating the Cookies. We have to use regular expressions to do the
work. If you are familiar with regular expressions you'll understand
whats going on. If you don't I suggest you either pick up a book on
the subject, read through the *pcrepattern* man page or read through
one of many online guides.

Let me show you what Varnish Software uses. We use some cookies for
Google Analytics tracking and similar tools. The cookies are all set
and used by Javascript. Varnish and Drupal doesn't need to see those
cookies and since Varnish will cease caching of pages when the client
sends cookies we will discard these unnecessary cookies in VCL. 

In the following VCL we discard all cookies that start with a
underscore::

  // Remove has_js and Google Analytics __* cookies.
  set req.http.Cookie = regsuball(req.http.Cookie, "(^|;\s*)(_[_a-z]+|has_js)=[^;]*", "");
  // Remove a ";" prefix, if present.
  set req.http.Cookie = regsub(req.http.Cookie, "^;\s*", "");

Let me show you an example where we remove everything except the
cookies named COOKIE1 and COOKIE2 and you can marvel at it::

  sub vcl_recv {
    if (req.http.Cookie) {
      set req.http.Cookie = ";" + req.http.Cookie;
      set req.http.Cookie = regsuball(req.http.Cookie, "; +", ";");
      set req.http.Cookie = regsuball(req.http.Cookie, ";(COOKIE1|COOKIE2)=", "; \1=");
      set req.http.Cookie = regsuball(req.http.Cookie, ";[^ ][^;]*", "");
      set req.http.Cookie = regsuball(req.http.Cookie, "^[; ]+|[; ]+$", "");

      if (req.http.Cookie == "") {
          remove req.http.Cookie;
      }
    }
  }

A somewhat simpler example that can accomplish almost the same can be
found below. Instead of filtering out the other cookies it picks out
the one cookie that is needed, copies it to another header and then
copies it back, deleting the original cookie header.::

  sub vcl_recv {
         # save the original cookie header so we can mangle it
        set req.http.X-Varnish-PHP_SID = req.http.Cookie;
        # using a capturing sub pattern, extract the continuous string of 
        # alphanumerics that immediately follows "PHPSESSID="
        set req.http.X-Varnish-PHP_SID = 
           regsuball(req.http.X-Varnish-PHP_SID, ";? ?PHPSESSID=([a-zA-Z0-9]+)( |;| ;).*","\1");
        set req.http.Cookie = req.X-Varnish-PHP_SID;
        remove req.X-Varnish-PHP_SID;
   }   

There are other scary examples of what can be done in VCL in the
Varnish Cache Wiki.


Cookies coming from the backend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your backend server sets a cookie using the Set-Cookie header
Varnish will not cache the page.  A hit-for-pass object (see
:ref:`tutorial-vcl_fetch_actions`) is created. So, if the backend
server acts silly and sets unwanted cookies just unset the Set-Cookie
header and all should be fine.
