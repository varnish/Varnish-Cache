Peculiarities
-------------

There are a couple of things that are different with Varnish Cache, as
opposed to other programs. One thing you've already seen -- VCL. I'll
just give you a very quick tour of the other peculiarities.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Varnish Configuration is written in VCL. When Varnish is run, this
configuration is transformed into C code and then fed into a C
compiler, loaded and run. So, as opposed to declaring various
settings, you write polices on how the incoming traffic should be
handled.


varnishadm
~~~~~~~~~~

Varnish Cache has an admin console. You can connect it it through the
``varnishadm`` command. In order to connect, the user needs to be able to
read ``/etc/varnish/secret`` in order to authenticate.

Once you've started the console, you can do quite a few operations on
Varnish, like stopping and starting the cache process, load VCL,
adjust the built-in load balancer, and invalidate cached content.

It has a built in command ``help`` which will give you some hints on
what it does.

varnishlog
~~~~~~~~~~

Varnish does not log to disk. Instead it logs to a bit of memory. It
is like a stream of log messages. At any time you'll be able to connect to the
stream and see what is going on. Varnish logs quite a bit of
information. You can have a look at the logstream with the command
``varnishlog``.
