Important command line arguments
--------------------------------

There a two command line arguments you will simply have to choose
values for: what TCP port to serve HTTP from, and where the backend
server can be contacted.

If you run Varnish from a package for your operating system,
you will find the startup options here:

* Debian, Ubuntu: ``/etc/default/varnish``
* Red Hat, Centos: ``/etc/sysconfig/varnish``
* FreeBSD: ``/etc/rc.conf`` (See also: ``/usr/local/etc/rc.d/varnishd``)


``-a`` *listen_address*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What address should Varnish listen to, and service HTTP requests from.

You will most likely want to set this to ":80" which is the Well
Known Port for HTTP.

You can specify multiple addresses separated by a comma, and you
can use numeric or host/service names if you like, varnish will try
to open and service as many of them as possible, but if none of them
can be opened, ``varnishd`` will not start.

Here are some examples::

	-a :80
	-a localhost:80
	-a 192.168.1.100:8080
	-a '[fe80::1]:80'
	-a '0.0.0.0:8080,[::]:8081'

If your webserver runs on the same computer, you will have to move
it to another port number first.
 
``-f`` *VCL-file* or ``-b`` *backend*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Varnish needs to know where to find the HTTP server it is caching for.
You can either specify it with ``-b``, or you can put it in your own VCL file.

Using ``-b`` is a quick way to get started::

	-b localhost:81
	-b thatotherserver.example.com:80
	-b 192.168.1.2:80

Notice that if you specify a name, it can at most resolve to one IPv4
*and* one IPv6 address.

If you go with ``-f``, you can start with a VCL file containing just::

	backend default {
		.host = "localhost:81";
	}

which is exactly what ``-b`` does.

In both cases, the default VCL code is appended.

Other options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Varnish has more command line arguments you can and maybe want
to tweak, but to get started, the above will be sufficient.

By default Varnish will use 100 megabytes of ``malloc(3)`` storage
for caching objects, if you want to cache more than that, you
should look at the ``-s`` argument.

If you run a really big site, you may want to tune the size of
the tread-pools and other parameters with the ``-p`` argument,
but we generally advise not to do that, unless you need to.

Before you go into production, you may also want to re-visit the
chapter
:ref:`run_security` to see if you need to partition administrative
privileges.

For a complete list of the command line parameters, please see
:ref:`ref-varnishd-options`.
