Requests, responses and objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In VCL, there several important objects.

``req``
 The *request* object. When Varnish has received the request,
 the ``req`` object is 
 created and populated. Most of the work you do in ``vcl_recv`` you 
 do on or with the ``req`` object.

``bereq``
 The backend request object. 

``beresp``
 The backend respons object. It contains the headers of the object 
 comming from the backend. Most of the work you do in ``vcl_fetch`` you 
 do on the ``beresp`` object.

``resp``
 The HTTP response right before it is delivered to the client. 

``obj`` 
 The object as it is stored in cache. Mostly read only.
