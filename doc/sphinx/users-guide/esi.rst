Content composition with Edge Side Includes
-------------------------------------------

Varnish can cache create web pages by assembling different pages, called `fragments`,
together into one page. These `fragments` can have individual cache policies. If you
have a web site with a list showing the five most popular articles on
your site, this list can probably be cached as a `fragment` and included
in all the other pages.

.. XXX:What other pages? benc

Used properly this strategy can dramatically increase
your hit rate and reduce the load on your servers.

In Varnish we've only so far implemented a small subset of ESI. As of version 2.1 we
have three ESI statements::

 esi:include
 esi:remove
 <!--esi ...-->

Content substitution based on variables and cookies is not implemented
but is on the roadmap. At least if you look at the roadmap from a
certain angle. During a full moon.

Varnish will not process ESI instructions in HTML comments.

Example: esi:include
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lets see an example how this could be used. This simple cgi script
outputs the date::

     #!/bin/sh

     echo 'Content-type: text/html'
     echo ''
     date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"

Now, lets have an HTML file that has an ESI include statement::

     <HTML>
     <BODY>
     The time is: <esi:include src="/cgi-bin/date.cgi"/>
     at this very moment.
     </BODY>
     </HTML>

For ESI to work you need to activate ESI processing in VCL, like this::

    sub vcl_backend_response {
    	if (bereq.url == "/test.html") {
           set beresp.do_esi = true; // Do ESI processing
           set beresp.ttl = 24 h;    // Sets the TTL on the HTML above
    	} elseif (bereq.url == "/cgi-bin/date.cgi") {
           set beresp.ttl = 1m;      // Sets a one minute TTL on
	       	       	 	     // the included object
        }
    }

Example: esi:remove and <!--esi ... -->
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The `<esi:remove>` and `<!--esi ... -->` constructs can be used to present
appropriate content whether or not ESI is available, for example you can
include content when ESI is available or link to it when it is not.
ESI processors will remove the start ("<!--esi") and the end ("-->") when
the page is processed, while still processing the contents. If the page
is not processed, it will remain intact, becoming a HTML/XML comment tag.
ESI processors will remove `<esi:remove>` tags and all content contained
in them, allowing you to only render the content when the page is not
being ESI-processed.
For example::

  <esi:remove>
    <a href="http://www.example.com/LICENSE">The license</a>
  </esi:remove>
  <!--esi
  <p>The full text of the license:</p>
  <esi:include src="http://example.com/LICENSE" />
  -->

Doing ESI on JSON and other non-XML'ish content
-----------------------------------------------

Please note that Varnish will peek at the included content. If it
doesn't start with a "<" Varnish assumes you didn't really mean to
include it and disregard it. You can alter this behaviour by setting
the 'esi_syntax' parameter (see ref:`ref-varnishd`).
