Built in subroutines
--------------------


``vcl_init``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Called when VCL is loaded, before any requests pass through it.
Typically used to initialize VMODs.

``return()`` values:

  ``ok``
    Normal return, VCL continues loading.

``vcl_recv``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Called at the beginning of a request, after the complete request has
been received and parsed.  Its purpose is to decide whether or not
to serve the request, how to do it, and, if applicable, which backend
to use.
  
The ``vcl_recv`` subroutine may terminate with calling ``return()`` 
on one of the following keywords:

``error code [reason]``
  Return the specified error code to the client and abandon the request.

``pass``
  Switch to pass mode.  Control will eventually pass to ``vcl_pass``.

``pipe``
  Switch to pipe mode.  Control will eventually pass to ``vcl_pipe``.

``lookup``
  Look up the requested object in the cache.  Control will
  eventually pass to ``vcl_hit`` or ``vcl_miss``, depending on whether the
  object is in the cache.  The ``bereq.method`` value will be set
  to ``GET`` regardless of the value of ``req.method``.


``vcl_pipe``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Called upon entering *pipe* mode.  In this mode, the request is passed
on to the backend, and any further data from either client or
backend is passed on unaltered until either end closes the
connection.
 
The ``vcl_pipe`` subroutine may terminate with calling ``return()`` 
with one of the following keywords:

``error code [reason]``
  Return the specified error code to the client and abandon the request.

``pipe``
  Proceed with *pipe* mode.

``vcl_pass``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Called upon entering *pass* mode.  In this mode, the request is passed
on to the backend, and the backend's response is passed on to the
client, but is not entered into the cache.  Subsequent requests
submitted over the same client connection are handled normally.
  
The ``vcl_pass`` subroutine may terminate with calling ``return()`` 
with one of the following keywords:

``error code [reason]``
  Return the specified error code to the client and abandon the request.

``pass``
  Proceed with *pass* mode.

``restart``
  Restart the transaction. Increases the restart counter. If the number 
  of restarts is higher than ``max_restarts``, varnish emits a guru meditation
  error.

``vcl_miss``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Called after a cache lookup if the requested document was not found in
the cache.  Its purpose is to decide whether or not to attempt to
retrieve the document from the backend, and which backend to use.
  
The ``vcl_miss`` subroutine may terminate with calling ``return()`` with one
of the following keywords:

``error code [reason]``
  Return the specified error code to the client and abandon the request.

``pass``
  Switch to *pass* mode.  Control will eventually pass to ``vcl_pass``.

``fetch``
  Retrieve the requested object from the backend.  Control will
  eventually pass to ``vcl_fetch``.

``vcl_fetch``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Called after a document has been successfully retrieved from the backend.
  
The ``vcl_fetch`` subroutine may terminate with calling ``return()`` with one
of the following keywords:

``deliver``
  Possibly insert the object into the cache, then deliver it to the
  client.  Control will eventually pass to ``vcl_deliver``.

``error code [reason]``
  Return the specified error code to the client and abandon the request.

``hit_for_pass``
  Pass in fetch. Passes the object without caching it. This will
  create a so-called ``hit_for_pass`` object which has the side effect
  that the decision not to cache will be cached. This is to allow
  would-be uncachable requests to be passed to the backend at the
  same time. The same logic is not necessary in ``vcl_recv`` because
  this happens before any potential queueing for an object takes
  place.  Note that the TTL for the ``hit_for_pass`` object will be set
  to what the current value of ``beresp.ttl`` is. Control will be
  handled to ``vcl_deliver`` on the current request, but subsequent
  requests will go directly to ``vcl_pass`` based on the ``hit_for_pass``
  object.

``restart``
  Restart the transaction. Increases the restart counter. If the number 
  of restarts is higher than ``max_restarts``, varnish emits a guru meditation 
  error.

``vcl_deliver``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Called before a cached object is delivered to the client.
  
The ``vcl_deliver`` subroutine may terminate with one of the following
keywords:

``deliver``
  Deliver the object to the client.

``restart``
  Restart the transaction. Increases the restart counter. If the number 
  of restarts is higher than ``max_restarts``, varnish emits a guru meditation 
  error.

``vcl_error``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Called when we hit an error, either explicitly or implicitly due to 
backend or internal errors.

The ``vcl_error`` subroutine may terminate by calling return with one of
the following keywords:
 
``deliver``
  Deliver the error object to the client.

``restart``
  Restart the transaction. Increases the restart counter. If the number 
  of restarts is higher than ``max_restarts``, varnish emits a guru meditation 
  error.

``vcl_fini``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Called when VCL is discarded only after all requests have exited the VCL.
Typically used to clean up VMODs.

``return()`` values:

``ok``
  Normal return, VCL will be discarded.
