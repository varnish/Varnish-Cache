VCL - Varnish Configuration Language
------------------------------------

This section is about getting Varnish to do what you want to
your HTTP traffic, using the Varnish Configuration Language.

Varnish has a great configuration system. Most other systems use
configuration directives, where you basically turn on and off lots of
switches. Varnish uses a domain specific language called Varnish
Configuration Language, or VCL for short. 

Every inbound request flows through Varnish and you can influence how
the request is handled by altering the VCL code. You can direct
certain requests to certain backends, you can alter the requests and
the responses, or have Varnish take various actions depending on
arbitrary properties of the request or the response. This makes
Varnish an extremly powerful HTTP processor, not just for caching.

Varnish translates VCL into binary code, which is then executed when
requests arrive. The performance impact of VCL is negligible.

The VCL files are organized into subroutines. The different subroutines
are executed at different times. One is executed when we get the
request, another when files are fetched from the backend server.

If you don't call an action in your subroutine and it reaches the end,
Varnish will execute some built-in VCL code. You will see this VCL
code commented out in ``default.vcl`` that ships with Varnish Cache.
