.. _users-guide-increasing_your_hitrate:

Achieving a high hitrate
------------------------

Now that Varnish is up and running you can access your web application
through Varnish. Unless your application is specifically written to
work behind a web accelerator you'll probably need to do some
changes to either the configuration or the application in order to
get a high hitrate in Varnish.

Varnish will not cache your data unless it's absolutely sure it is
safe to do so. So, for you to understand how Varnish decides if and
how to cache a page, we'll guide you through a couple of tools that
you should find useful to understand what is happening in your
Varnish setup.

Note that you need a tool to see the HTTP headers that fly between
Varnish and the backend. On the Varnish server, the easiest way to do
this is to use :ref:`varnishlog(1)` and :ref:`varnishtop(1)` but
sometimes a client-side tool makes sense. Here are the ones we
commonly use.

Tool: varnishtop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use varnishtop to identify what URLs are hitting the backend
the most. ``varnishtop -i BereqURL`` is an essential command, showing
you the top requests Varnish is sending to the backend. You can see some
other examples of :ref:`varnishtop(1)` usage in :ref:`users-guide-statistics`.


Tool: varnishlog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you have identified an URL which is frequently sent to the
backend you can use :ref:`varnishlog(1)` to have a look at the
request.  ``varnishlog -q 'ReqURL ~ "^/foo/bar"'`` will show you the
requests coming from the client matching `/foo/bar`.

For more information on how :ref:`varnishlog(1)` works please see
:ref:`users-guide-logging` or then man page.

For extended diagnostics headers, see
https://www.varnish-cache.org/trac/wiki/VCLExampleHitMissHeader


Tool: lwp-request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`lwp-request` is tool that is a part of The World-Wide Web library
for Perl. It's a couple of really basic programs that can execute
an HTTP request and show you the result. We mostly use the two
programs, ``GET`` and ``HEAD``.

vg.no was the first site to use Varnish and the people running Varnish
there are quite clueful. So it's interesting to look at their HTTP
Headers. Let's send a GET request for their home page::

  $ GET -H 'Host: www.vg.no' -Used http://vg.no/
  GET http://vg.no/
  Host: www.vg.no
  User-Agent: lwp-request/5.834 libwww-perl/5.834

  200 OK
  Cache-Control: must-revalidate
  Refresh: 600
  Title: VG Nett - Forsiden - VG Nett
  X-Age: 463
  X-Cache: HIT
  X-Rick-Would-Never: Let you down
  X-VG-Jobb: http://www.finn.no/finn/job/fulltime/result?keyword=vg+multimedia Merk:HeaderNinja
  X-VG-Korken: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fcj8CnD5188
  X-VG-WebCache: joanie
  X-VG-WebServer: leon

OK. Lets look at what ``GET`` does. ``GET`` usually sends off HTTP 0.9
requests, which lack the 'Host' header. So we add a 'Host' header with the
'-H' option. '-U' print request headers, '-s' prints response status, '-e'
prints response headers and '-d' discards the actual content. We don't
really care about the content, only the headers.

As you can see, VG adds quite a bit of information in their
headers. Some of the headers, like the 'X-Rick-Would-Never' are specific
to vg.no and their somewhat odd sense of humour. Others, like the
'X-VG-Webcache' are for debugging purposes.

So, to check whether a site sets cookies for a specific URL, just do::

  GET -Used http://example.com/ |grep ^Set-Cookie

.. XXX:Missing explanation and sample for HEAD here. benc

Tool: Live HTTP Headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is also a plugin for Firefox called `Live HTTP Headers`. This
plugin can show you what headers are being sent and received.
`Live HTTP Headers` can be found at
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3829/ or by googling
"Live HTTP Headers".


The role of HTTP Headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Along with each HTTP request and response comes a bunch of headers
carrying metadata. Varnish will look at these headers to determine if
it is appropriate to cache the contents and how long Varnish can keep
the content cached.

Please note that when Varnish considers these headers Varnish actually
considers itself *part of* the actual webserver. The rationale being
that both are under your control.

The term *surrogate origin cache* is not really well defined by the
IETF or RFC 2616 so the various ways Varnish works might differ from
your expectations.

Let's take a look at the important headers you should be aware of:

.. _users-guide-cookies:

Cookies
-------

Varnish will, in the default configuration, not cache an object coming
from the backend with a 'Set-Cookie' header present. Also, if the client
sends a Cookie header, Varnish will bypass the cache and go directly to
the backend.

This can be overly conservative. A lot of sites use Google Analytics
(GA) to analyze their traffic. GA sets a cookie to track you. This
cookie is used by the client side javascript and is therefore of no
interest to the server.

Cookies from the client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a lot of web applications it makes sense to completely disregard the
cookies unless you are accessing a special part of the web site. This
VCL snippet in `vcl_recv` will disregard cookies unless you are
accessing `/admin/`::

    if (!(req.url ~ "^/admin/")) {
        unset req.http.Cookie;
    }

Quite simple. If, however, you need to do something more complicated,
like removing one out of several cookies, things get
difficult. Unfortunately Varnish doesn't have good tools for
manipulating the Cookies. We have to use regular expressions to do the
work. If you are familiar with regular expressions you'll understand
whats going on. If you aren't we recommend that you either pick up a book on
the subject, read through the *pcrepattern* man page, or read through
one of many online guides.

Lets use the Varnish Software (VS) web as an example here. Very
simplified the setup VS uses can be described as a Drupal-based
backend with a Varnish cache in front. VS uses some cookies for
Google Analytics tracking and similar tools. The cookies are all
set and used by Javascript. Varnish and Drupal doesn't need to see
those cookies and since Varnish will cease caching of pages when
the client sends cookies Varnish will discard these unnecessary
cookies in VCL.

In the following VCL we discard all cookies that start with an
underscore::

    # Remove has_js and Google Analytics __* cookies.
    set req.http.Cookie = regsuball(req.http.Cookie, "(^|;\s*)(_[_a-z]+|has_js)=[^;]*", "");
    # Remove a ";" prefix, if present.
    set req.http.Cookie = regsub(req.http.Cookie, "^;\s*", "");

Lets look at an example where we remove everything except the
cookies named "COOKIE1" and "COOKIE2" and you can marvel at the "beauty" of it::

    sub vcl_recv {
        if (req.http.Cookie) {
            set req.http.Cookie = ";" + req.http.Cookie;
            set req.http.Cookie = regsuball(req.http.Cookie, "; +", ";");
            set req.http.Cookie = regsuball(req.http.Cookie, ";(COOKIE1|COOKIE2)=", "; \1=");
            set req.http.Cookie = regsuball(req.http.Cookie, ";[^ ][^;]*", "");
            set req.http.Cookie = regsuball(req.http.Cookie, "^[; ]+|[; ]+$", "");

            if (req.http.Cookie == "") {
                unset req.http.Cookie;
            }
        }
    }

A somewhat simpler example that can accomplish almost the same functionality can be
found below. Instead of filtering out "other" cookies it instead picks out
"the one" cookie that is needed, copies it to another header and then
copies it back to the request, deleting the original cookie header.
.. XXX:Verify correctness of request above! benc
::

    sub vcl_recv {
        # save the original cookie header so we can mangle it
        set req.http.X-Varnish-PHP_SID = req.http.Cookie;
        # using a capturing sub pattern, extract the continuous string of
        # alphanumerics that immediately follows "PHPSESSID="
        set req.http.X-Varnish-PHP_SID =
           regsuball(req.http.X-Varnish-PHP_SID, ";? ?PHPSESSID=([a-zA-Z0-9]+)( |;| ;).*","\1");
        set req.http.Cookie = req.X-Varnish-PHP_SID;
        unset req.X-Varnish-PHP_SID;
    }

There are other scary examples of what can be done in VCL in the
Varnish Cache Wiki.

.. XXX:Missing link here.


Cookies coming from the backend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your backend server sets a cookie using the 'Set-Cookie' header
Varnish will not cache the page when using the default configuration.
A `hit-for-pass` object (see :ref:`user-guide-vcl_actions`) is
created.  So, if the backend server acts silly and sets unwanted
cookies just unset the 'Set-Cookie' header and all should be fine.


Cache-Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 'Cache-Control' header instructs caches how to handle the content. Varnish
cares about the *max-age* parameter and uses it to calculate the TTL
for an object.

So make sure you issue a 'Cache-Control' header with a max-age
header. You can have a look at what Varnish Software's Drupal server
issues::

  $ GET -Used http://www.varnish-software.com/|grep ^Cache-Control
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=600

Age
~~~

Varnish adds an 'Age' header to indicate how long the object has been
kept inside Varnish. You can grep out 'Age' from :ref:`varnishlog(1)`
with ``varnishlog -I RespHeader:^Age``.

Pragma
~~~~~~

An HTTP 1.0 server might send the header ``Pragma: nocache``. Varnish ignores this
header. You could easily add support for this header in VCL.

In `vcl_backend_response`::

    if (beresp.http.Pragma ~ "nocache") {
        set beresp.uncacheable = true;
        set beresp.ttl = 120s; # how long not to cache this url.
    }

Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If Varnish sees an 'Authorization' header it will pass the request. If
this is not what you want you can unset the header.

Overriding the time-to-live (TTL)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes your backend will misbehave. It might, depending on your
setup, be easier to override the TTL in Varnish then to fix your
somewhat cumbersome backend.

You need VCL to identify the objects you want and then you set the
'beresp.ttl' to whatever you want::

    sub vcl_backend_response {
        if (bereq.url ~ "^/legacy_broken_cms/") {
            set beresp.ttl = 5d;
        }
    }

This example will set the TTL to 5 days for the old legacy stuff on
your site.

Forcing caching for certain requests and certain responses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since you still might have this cumbersome backend that isn't very friendly
to work with you might want to override more stuff in Varnish. We
recommend that you rely as much as you can on the default caching
rules. It is perfectly easy to force Varnish to lookup an object in
the cache but it isn't really recommended.


Normalizing your namespace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some sites are accessed via lots of hostnames.
http://www.varnish-software.com/, http://varnish-software.com/ and
http://varnishsoftware.com/ all point at the same site. Since Varnish
doesn't know they are the same,
.. XXX: heavy meaning change above. benc
Varnish will cache different versions of every page for every
hostname. You can mitigate this in your web server configuration
by setting up redirects or by using the following VCL::

    if (req.http.host ~ "(?i)^(www.)?varnish-?software.com") {
        set req.http.host = "varnish-software.com";
    }


.. _users-guide-vary:

HTTP Vary
---------

*HTTP Vary is not a trivial concept. It is by far the most misunderstood
HTTP header.*

A lot of the response headers tell the client something about the
HTTP object being delivered. Clients can request different variants
of a HTTP object, based on their preference. Their preferences might
cover stuff like encoding or language. When a client prefers UK
English this is indicated through ``Accept-Language: en-uk``. Caches
need to keep these different variants apart and this is done through
the HTTP response header 'Vary'.

When a backend server issues a ``Vary: Accept-Language`` it tells
Varnish that its needs to cache a separate version for every different
Accept-Language that is coming from the clients.

If two clients say they accept the languages "en-us, en-uk" and
"da, de" respectively, Varnish will cache and serve two different
versions of the page if the backend indicated that Varnish needs
to vary on the 'Accept-Language' header.

Please note that the headers that 'Vary' refer to need to match
*exactly* for there to be a match. So Varnish will keep two copies
of a page if one of them was created for "en-us, en-uk" and the
other for "en-us,en-uk". Just the lack of a whitespace will force
Varnish to cache another version.

To achieve a high hitrate whilst using Vary is there therefore
crucial to normalize the headers the backends varies on. Remember,
just a difference in casing can force different cache entries.

The following VCL code will normalize the 'Accept-Language' header to
either "en", "de" or "fr", in this order of precedence::

    if (req.http.Accept-Language) {
        if (req.http.Accept-Language ~ "en") {
            set req.http.Accept-Language = "en";
        } elsif (req.http.Accept-Language ~ "de") {
            set req.http.Accept-Language = "de";
        } elsif (req.http.Accept-Language ~ "fr") {
            set req.http.Accept-Language = "fr";
        } else {
            # unknown language. Remove the accept-language header and
            # use the backend default.
            unset req.http.Accept-Language
        }
    }

Vary parse errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Varnish will return a "503 internal server error" page when it fails
to parse the 'Vary' header, or if any of the client headers listed
in the Vary header exceeds the limit of 65k characters. An 'SLT_Error'
log entry is added in these cases.

Pitfall - Vary: User-Agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some applications or application servers send ``Vary: User-Agent``
along with their content. This instructs Varnish to cache a separate
copy for every variation of 'User-Agent' there is and there are
plenty. Even a single patchlevel of the same browser will generate
at least 10 different 'User-Agent' headers based just on what
operating system they are running.

So if you *really* need to vary based on 'User-Agent' be sure to
normalize the header or your hit rate will suffer badly. Use the
above code as a template.
