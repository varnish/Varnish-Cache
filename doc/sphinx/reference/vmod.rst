VMOD - Varnish Modules
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For all you can do in VCL, there are things you can not do.
Look an IP number up in a database file for instance.
VCL provides for inline C code, and there you can do everything,
but it is not a convenient or even readable way to solve such
problems.

This is where VMODs come into the picture:   A VMOD is a shared
library with some C functions which can be called from VCL code.

For instance::

	import std;

	sub vcl_deliver {
		set resp.http.foo = std.toupper(req.url);
	}

The "std" vmod is one you get with Varnish, it will always be there
and we will put "boutique" functions in it, such as the "toupper"
function shown above.  The full contents of the "std" module is
documented in vmod_std(7).

This part of the manual is about how you go about writing your own
VMOD, how the language interface between C and VCC works, where you 
can find contributed VMODs etc. This explanation will use the "std"
VMOD as example, having a varnish source tree handy may be a good
idea.

VMOD Directory
==============

The VMOD directory is an up-to-date compilation of maintained
extensions written for Varnish Cache:
 https://www.varnish-cache.org/vmods

The vmod.vcc file
=================

The interface between your VMOD and the VCL compiler ("VCC") and the
VCL runtime ("VRT") is defined in the vmod.vcc file which a python
script called "vmod.py" turns into thaumaturgically challenged C
data structures that does all the hard work.

The std VMODs vmod.vcc file looks somewhat like this::

	Module std
	Init init_function
	Function STRING toupper(PRIV_CALL, STRING_LIST)
	Function STRING tolower(PRIV_VCL, STRING_LIST)
	Function VOID set_ip_tos(INT)

The first line gives the name of the module, nothing special there.

The second line specifies an optional "Init" function, which will
be called whenever a VCL program which imports this VMOD is loaded.
This gives a chance to initialize the module before any of the
functions it implements are called.  More on this below.

The next three lines specify two functions in the VMOD, along with the
types of the arguments, and that is probably where the hardest bit
of writing a VMOD is to be found, so we will talk about that at length
in a moment.

Notice that the third function returns VOID, that makes it a "procedure"
in VCL lingo, meaning that it cannot be used in expressions, right
side of assignments and such places.  Instead it can be used as a
primary action, something functions which return a value can not::

	sub vcl_recv {
		std.set_ip_tos(32);
	}

Running vmod.py on the vmod.vcc file, produces an "vcc_if.c" and
"vcc_if.h" files, which you must use to build your shared library
file.

Forget about vcc_if.c everywhere but your Makefile, you will never
need to care about its contents, and you should certainly never
modify it, that voids your warranty instantly.

But vcc_if.h is important for you, it contains the prototypes for
the functions you want to export to VCL.

For the std VMOD, the compiled vcc_if.h file looks like this::

	struct sess;
	struct VCL_conf;
	const char * vmod_toupper(struct sess *, struct vmod_priv *, const char *, ...);
	const char * vmod_tolower(struct sess *, struct vmod_priv *, const char *, ...);
	int meta_function(void **, const struct VCL_conf *);

Those are your C prototypes.  Notice the ``vmod_`` prefix on the function
names and the C-types as return types and arguments.

VCL and C data types
====================

VCL data types are targeted at the job, so for instance, we have data
types like "DURATION" and "HEADER", but they all have some kind of C
language representation.  Here is a description of them, from simple
to nasty.

INT
	C-type: ``int``

	An integer as we know and love them.

REAL
	C-type: ``double``

	A floating point value

DURATION
	C-type: ``double``

	Units: seconds

	A time interval, as in "25 minutes".

TIME
	C-type: ``double``

	Units: seconds since UNIX epoch

	An absolute time, as in "Mon Sep 13 19:06:01 UTC 2010".

STRING
	C-type: ``const char *``

	A NUL-terminated text-string.

	Can be NULL to indicate that the nonexistent string, for
	instance::

		mymod.foo(req.http.foobar);

	If there were no "foobar" HTTP header, the vmod_foo()
	function would be passed a NULL pointer as argument.

	When used as a return value, the producing function is
	responsible for arranging memory management.  Either by
	freeing the string later by whatever means available or
	by using storage allocated from the session or worker
	workspaces.

STRING_LIST
	C-type: ``const char *, ...``

	A multi-component text-string.  We try very hard to avoid
	doing text-processing in Varnish, and this is one way we
	do that, by not editing separate pieces of a sting together
	to one string, until we need to.

	Consider this contrived example::

		set bereq.http.foo = std.toupper(req.http.foo + req.http.bar);

	The usual way to do this, would be be to allocate memory for
	the concatenated string, then pass that to ``toupper()`` which in
	turn would return another freshly allocated string with the
	modified result.  Remember: strings in VCL are ``const``, we
	cannot just modify the string in place.

	What we do instead, is declare that ``toupper()`` takes a "STRING_LIST"
	as argument.  This makes the C function implementing ``toupper()``
	a vararg function (see the prototype above) and responsible for
	considering all the ``const char *`` arguments it finds, until the
	magic marker "vrt_magic_string_end" is encountered.

	Bear in mind that the individual strings in a STRING_LIST can be
	NULL, as described under STRING, that is why we do not use NULL
	as the terminator.

	Right now we only support STRING_LIST being the last argument to
	a function, we may relax that at a latter time.

	If you don't want to bother with STRING_LIST, just use STRING
	and make sure your thread_pool_workspace param is big enough.

PRIV_VCL
	See below

PRIV_CALL
	See below

VOID
	C-type: ``void``

	Can only be used for return-value, which makes the function a VCL
	procedure.

HEADER
	C-type: ``enum gethdr_e, const char *``

	XXX: explain me

IP, BOOL
	XXX: these types are not released for use in vmods yet.


Private Pointers
================

It is often useful for library functions to maintain local state,
this can be anything from a precompiled regexp to open file descriptors
and vast data structures.

The VCL compiler supports two levels of private pointers, "per call"
and "per VCL"

"per call" private pointers are useful to cache/store state relative
to the specific call or its arguments, for instance a compiled regular
expression specific to a regsub() statement or a simply caching the
last output of some expensive lookup.

"per vcl" private pointers are useful for such global state that
applies to all calls in this VCL, for instance flags that determine
if regular expressions are case-sensitive in this vmod or similar.

The way it works in the vmod code, is that a ``struct vmod_priv *`` is
passed to the functions where argument type PRIV_VCL or PRIV_CALL
is specified.

This structure contains two members::

	typedef void vmod_priv_free_f(void *);
	struct vmod_priv {
		void                    *priv;
		vmod_priv_free_f        *free;
	};

The "priv" element can be used for whatever the vmod code wants to
use it for, it defaults to a NULL pointer.

The "free" element defaults to NULL, and it is the modules responsibility
to set it to a suitable function, which can clean up whatever the "priv"
pointer points to.

When a VCL program is discarded, all private pointers are checked
to see if both the "priv" and "free" elements are non-NULL, and if
they are, the "free" function will be called with the "priv" pointer
as only argument.

The per-call vmod_privs are freed before the per-vcl vmod_priv.

Init functions
==============

VMODs can have an "init" method which is called when a VCL
which imports the VMOD is initialized.

The first argument to the init function is the vmod_priv specific
to this particular VCL, and if necessary, a VCL specific VMOD "fini"
function can be attached to its "free" hook.

(The second argument is a pointer to the VCL's config structure,
it is not at all obvious what you can use this for in practice,
but we provide it just in case.)

Please notice that there is no "global" fini method.

If the VMOD has private global state, which includes any sockets
or files opened, any memory allocated to global or private variables
in the C-code etc, it is the VMODs own responsibility to track how
many VCLs have called init (& fini) and free this global state
when the count reaches zero.

When to lock, and when not to lock
==================================

Varnish is heavily multithreaded, so by default VMODs must implement
their own locking to protect shared resources.

When a VCL is loaded or unloaded, the initialization and teardown
is run sequentially in a single thread, and there is guaranteed
to be no other activity related to this particular VCL, nor are
there  init/fini activity in any other VCL or VMOD at this time.

That means that the VMOD init, and any object init/fini functions
are already serialized in sensible order, and won't need any locking,
unless they access VMOD specific global state, shared with other VCLs.
