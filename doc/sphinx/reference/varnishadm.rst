SYNOPSIS
========

::

       varnishadm [-t timeout] [-S secret_file] [-T address:port] [-n name] [command [...]]

DESCRIPTION
===========

The ``varnishadm`` utility establishes a CLI connection to ``varnishd`` either
using ``-n`` *name* or using the ``-T`` and ``-S`` arguments.
If ``-n`` *name* is
given the location of the secret file and the address:port is looked
up in shared memory. If neither is given ``varnishadm`` will look for an
instance without a given name.

If a command is given, the command and arguments are sent over the CLI
connection and the result returned on ``stdout``.

If no command argument is given, ``varnishadm`` will pass commands and
replies between the CLI socket and ``stdin``/``stdout``.

OPTIONS
=======

 ``-t timeout``
	Wait no longer than this many seconds for an operation to finish.

 ``-S secret_file``
        Specify the authentication secret file. This should be the same ``-S`` 
        argument as was given to ``varnishd``. Only processes which can read 
        the contents of this file, will be able to authenticate the CLI connection.

 ``-T address:port   ``
        Connect to the management interface at the specified address and port.

 ``-n name``
	Connect to the instance of ``varnishd`` with this name.

The syntax and operation of the actual CLI interface is described in
the ``varnish-cli(7)`` manual page. Parameters are described in
``varnishd(1)`` manual page.  

Additionally, a summary of commands can be obtained by issuing the
``help`` command, and a summary of parameters can be obtained by issuing
the ``param.show`` command.

EXIT STATUS
===========

If a command is given, the exit status of the ``varnishadm`` utility is
zero if the command succeeded, and non-zero otherwise.

EXAMPLES
========

Some ways you can use ``varnishadm``::

   varnishadm -T localhost:999 -S /var/db/secret vcl.use foo
   echo vcl.use foo | varnishadm -T localhost:999 -S /var/db/secret
   echo vcl.use foo | ssh vhost varnishadm -T localhost:999 -S /var/db/secret
