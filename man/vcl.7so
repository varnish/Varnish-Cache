.Sh NAME
.Nm VCL
.Nd Varnish Configuration Language
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
language is a small domain-specific language designed to be used to
define request handling and document caching policies for the Varnish
HTTP accelerator.
.Pp
When a new configuration is loaded, the
.Nm varnishd
management process translates the VCL code to C and compiles it to a
shared object which is then dynamically linked into the server
process.
.Ss Syntax
The VCL syntax is very simple, and deliberately similar to C and Perl.
Blocks are delimited by curly braces, statements end with semicolons,
and comments may be written as in C, C++ or Perl according to your own
preferences.
.Pp
In addition to the C-like assignment (=), comparison (==) and boolean
(!, && and ||) operators, VCL supports regular expression and ACL
matching using the ~ operator.
.Pp
Unlike C and Perl, the backslash (\\) character has no special meaning
in strings in VCL, which use the (%xx) escape mechanism just like URLs,
so it can be freely used in regular expressions without doubling.
.Pp
Assignments are introduced with the
.Cm set
keyword.
There are no user-defined variables; values can only be assigned to
variables attached to backend, request or document objects.
Most of these are typed, and the values assigned to them must have a
compatible unit suffix.
.Pp
VCL has
.Cm if
tests, but no loops.
.Pp
The contents of another VCL file may be inserted at any point in the
code by using the
.Cm include
keyword followed by the name of the other file as a quoted string.
.Ss Backend declarations
A backend declaration creates and initializes a named backend object:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
backend www {
    .host = "www.example.com";
    .port = "http";
}
.Ed
.Pp
The backend object can later be used to select a backend at request
time:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
if (req.http.host ~ "^(www\.)?example.com$") {
    set req.backend = www;
}
.Ed
.Ss Directors
Directors choose from different backends based on health status and a
per-director algorithm.
There currently exists a round-robin and a random director.  
.Pp
Directors are defined using:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
director b2 random {
    .retries = 5;
    {
        /* We can refer to named backends */
        .backend        = b1;
        .weight         = 7;
    }
    {
        /* Or define them inline */
        .backend        = {
            .host = "fs2";
        }
        .weight         = 3;
    }
}
.Ed
.Ss The random director
The random director takes one per-director option
.Fa .retries .
This specifies how many tries it will use to find a working backend.
The default is the same as the number of backends defined for the
director.
.Pp
There is also a per-backend option: weight which defines the portion
of traffic to send to the particular backend.
.Ss The round-robin director
The round-robin does not take any options.
.Ss Backend probes
Backends can be probed to see whether they should be considered
healthy or not.  The return status can also be checked by using 
.Fa req.backend.healthy
.
.Fa .window
is how many of the latest polls we examine, while
.Fa .threshold
is how many of those must have succeeded for us to consider the
backend healthy.
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
backend www {
    .host = "www.example.com";
    .port = "http";
    .probe = {
        .url = "/test.jpg";
        .timeout = 0.3 s;
	.window = 8;
	.threshold = 3;
    }
}
.Ed
It is also possible to specify the raw HTTP request.
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
backend www {
    .host = "www.example.com";
    .port = "http";
    .probe = {
        # NB: \\r\\n automatically inserted after each string!
        .request =
            "GET / HTTP/1.1"
            "Host: www.foo.bar"
            "Connection: close";
    }
}
.Ed
.Ss ACLs
An ACL declaration creates and initializes a named access control list
which can later be used to match client addresses:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
acl local {
    "localhost";         /* myself */
    "192.0.2.0"/24;      /* and everyone on the local network */
    ! "192.0.2.23";      /* except for the dialin router */
}
.Ed
.Pp
If an ACL entry specifies a host name which Varnish is unable to
resolve, it will match any address it is compared to.
Consequently, if it is preceded by a negation mark, it will reject any
address it is compared to, which may not be what you intended.
If the entry is enclosed in parentheses, however, it will simply be
ignored.
.Pp
To match an IP address against an ACL, simply use the match operator:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
if (client.ip ~ local) {
    pipe;
}
.Ed
.Ss Functions
The following built-in functions are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fn regsub "str" "regex" "sub"
Returns a copy of
.Fa str
with the first occurrence of the regular expression
.Fa regex
replaced with
.Fa sub .
Within
.Fa sub ,
.Va $0
(which can also be spelled
.Va & )
is replaced with the entire matched string, and
.Va $n
is replaced with the contents of subgroup
.Ar n
in the matched string.
.It Fn regsuball "str" "regex" "sub"
As
.Fn regsuball
but this replaces all occurrences.
.It Fn purge_hash "regex"
Purge all objects in cache whose hash strings match
.Fa regex .
.It Fn purge_url "regex"
Purge all objects in cache whose URLs match
.Fa regex .
.El
.Ss Subroutines
A subroutine is used to group code for legibility or reusability:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
sub pipe_if_local {
    if (client.ip ~ local) {
        pipe;
    }
}
.Ed
.Pp
Subroutines in VCL do not take arguments, nor do they return values.
.Pp
If multiple subroutines with the same name are defined, they are
concatenated in the order in which the appear in the source.
.Pp
To call a subroutine, use the
.Cm call
keyword followed by the subroutine's name:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
call pipe_if_local;
.Ed
.Pp
There are a number of special subroutines which hook into the Varnish
workflow.
These subroutines may inspect and manipulate HTTP headers and various
other aspects of each request, and to a certain extent decide how the
request should be handled.
Each subroutine terminates by calling one of a small number of
keywords which indicates the desired outcome.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.\" vcl_recv
.It Cm vcl_recv
Called at the beginning of a request, after the complete request has
been received and parsed.
Its purpose is to decide whether or not to serve the request, how to
do it, and, if applicable, which backend to use.
.Pp
The
.Cm vcl_recv
subroutine may terminate with one of the following keywords:
.Bl -tag -width indent

.Cm vcl_hit
or
.Cm vcl_miss ,
depending on whether the object is in the cache.
.El

.Cm vcl_deliver .
.El
.\" vcl_miss
.It Cm vcl_miss
Called after a cache lookup if the requested document was not found in
the cache.
Its purpose is to decide whether or not to attempt to retrieve the

its expiry time.
.Pp
The
.Cm vcl_timeout
subroutine may terminate with one of the following keywords:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm fetch
Request a fresh copy of the object from the backend.
.It Cm discard
Discard the object.
.El
.\" vcl_discard
.It Cm vcl_discard
Called by the reaper thread when a cached document is about to be
discarded, either because it has expired or because space is running
low.
.Pp
The
.Cm vcl_discard
subroutine may terminate with one of the following keywords:

.It Cm discard
Discard the object.
.It Cm keep
Keep the object in cache.
.El
.El
.Pp
If one of these subroutines is left undefined or terminates without
reaching a handling decision, control will be handed over to the
builtin default.
See the
.Sx EXAMPLES
section for a listing of the default code.

.Pp
The following example shows how to support multiple sites running on
separate backends in the same Varnish instance, by selecting backends
based on the request URL.
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
backend www {
    .host = "www.example.com";
    .port = "80";
}

backend images {
    .host = "images.example.com";

        set req.backend = images;
    } else {
        error 404 "Unknown virtual host";
    }
}
.Ed
.Pp
The following snippet demonstrates how to force a minimum TTL for all
documents.
Note that this is not the same as setting the
.Va default_ttl
run-time parameter, as that only affects document for which the
backend did not specify a TTL.
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
sub vcl_fetch {
    if (obj.ttl < 120s) {
        set obj.ttl = 120s;
    }
}
.Ed
.Pp
The following snippet demonstrates how to force Varnish to cache
documents even when cookies are present.
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
sub vcl_recv {
    if (req.request == "GET" && req.http.cookie) {
        lookup;
    }
}

sub vcl_fetch {
    if (obj.http.Set-Cookie) {
        insert;
    }
}
.Ed
.Pp
The following code implements the HTTP PURGE method as used by Squid
for object invalidation:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
acl purge {
        "localhost";
        "192.0.2.1"/24;
}

sub vcl_recv {
    if (req.request == "PURGE") {
        if (!client.ip ~ purge) {
            error 405 "Not allowed.";
        }
        lookup;
    }
}

sub vcl_hit {
    if (req.request == "PURGE") {
        set obj.ttl = 0s;
        error 200 "Purged.";
    }
}

sub vcl_miss {
    if (req.request == "PURGE") {
        error 404 "Not in cache.";
    }
}
