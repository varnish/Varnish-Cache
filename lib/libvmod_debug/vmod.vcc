$Module debug 3 Development, test and debug

DESCRIPTION
===========

This vmod is used to develop, test and debug the various aspects
of VMOD handling in Varnish.


$Event event_function
$Function VOID panic(STRING_LIST)

Don't.

$Function STRING author(ENUM { phk, des, kristian, mithrandir } person="phk")

Test function for ENUM arguments

$Function VOID test_priv_call(PRIV_CALL)

Test function for call private pointers

$Function VOID test_priv_vcl(PRIV_VCL)

Test function for VCL private pointers

$Function STRING test_priv_task(PRIV_TASK, STRING)

Test function for TASK private pointers

$Function STRING test_priv_top(PRIV_TOP, STRING)

Test function for TOP private pointers

$Function BLOB str2blob(STRING src="foo")

Turn a string into a blob

$Function STRING blob2hex(BLOB src)

Hexdump a blob

$Function BACKEND no_backend()

Fails at backend selection

$Object obj(STRING, ENUM { one, two, three } number="one")

Test object

.. NOTE: .enum before .foo as part of test r01332.vtc
$Method VOID .enum(ENUM { phk, des, kristian, mithrandir, martin })

Testing that enums work as part of object and that the parser isn't
(too) buggy.

$Method STRING .foo(STRING why)

Foo indeed.

$Method TIME .date()

You never know when you need a date.

$Function VOID rot52(HTTP hdr)

Encrypt the HTTP header with quad-ROT13 encryption,
(this is approx 33% better than triple-DES).

$Function STRING argtest(STRING one, REAL two=2, STRING three="3",
	  STRING comma=",")

$Function INT vre_limit()

$Function VOID register_exp_callback(PRIV_VCL)

Register the vmod to receive expiry callbacks

$Function VOID init_fail()

Function to fail vcl_init{}

$Function VOID sleep(DURATION)

Sleep the current worker thread.

$Object dyn(STRING addr, STRING port)

Dynamically create a single-backend director

$Method BACKEND .backend()

Return the dynamic backend.

$Method VOID .refresh(STRING addr, STRING port)

Dynamically refresh & (always!) replace the backend by a new one.

$Function VOID workspace_allocate(ENUM { client, backend, session, thread }, INT SIZE)

Allocate and zero out SIZE bytes from a workspace.

$Function BOOL workspace_overflowed(ENUM { client, backend, session, thread })

Return if the workspace overflow mark is set or not.

$Function VOID workspace_overflow(ENUM { client, backend, session, thread })

Mark a workspace as overflowed.

$Function INT workspace_free(ENUM { client, backend, session, thread })

Find how much unallocated space there is left in a workspace.

$Function VOID workspace_snap(ENUM { client, backend, session, thread})

Snapshot the named workspace. Only one snapshot may be active at a time.

$Function VOID workspace_reset(ENUM { client, backend, session, thread })

Reset to the previous snapshot of a workspace, taken from debug.workspace_snap.

$Function VOID vcl_release_delay(DURATION)

Hold a reference to the VCL when it goes cold for the given delay.
