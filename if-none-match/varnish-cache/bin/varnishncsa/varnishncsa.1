.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads
.Xr varnishd 1
shared memory logs and presents them in the Apache / NCSA
"combined" log format.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl a
When writing to a file, append to it rather than overwrite it.
.It Fl b
Include log entries which result from communication with a backend
server.
If neither
.Fl b
nor
.Fl c
is specified,
.Nm
acts as if they both were.
.It Fl C
Ignore case when matching regular expressions.
.It Fl c
Include log entries which result from communication with a client.
If neither
.Fl b
nor
.Fl c
is specified,
.Nm
acts as if they both were.
.It Fl D
Daemonize.
.It Fl d
Process old log entries on startup.
Normally,
.Nm
will only process entries which are written to the log after it
starts.
.It Fl f
Prefer the
.Va X-Forwarded-For
HTTP header over 
.Va client.ip
in the log output.
.It Fl I Ar regex
Include log entries which match the specified regular expression.
If neither
.Fl I
nor
.Fl i
is specified, all log entries are included.
.It Fl i Ar tag
Include log entries with the specified tag.
If neither
.Fl I
nor
.Fl i
is specified, all log entries are included.
.It Fl n
Specifies the name of the
.Nm varnishd
instance to get logs from.
If
.Fl n
is not specified, the host name is used.
.It Fl P Ar file
Write the process's PID to the specified
.Ar file .
.It Fl r Ar file
Read log entries from
.Ar file
instead of shared memory.
.It Fl V
Display the version number and exit.
.It Fl w Ar file
Write log entries to
.Ar file
instead of displaying them.
The file will be overwritten unless the
.Fl a
option was specified.
.Pp
If
.Nm
receives a
.Dv SIGHUP
while writing to a file, it will reopen the file, allowing the old one
to be rotated away.
.It Fl X Ar regex
Exclude log entries which match the specified regular expression.
.It Fl x Ar tag
Exclude log entries with the specified tag.
