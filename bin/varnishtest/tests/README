Test-scripts for varnishtest
============================

Naming scheme
-------------

	The intent is to be able to run all script sin lexicographic
	order and get a sensible failure mode.

	This requires more basic tests to be earlier and more complex
	tests to be later in the test sequence, we do this with the
	prefix/id letter:

		[id]%05d.vtc

	id ~ [a] --> varnishtest(1) tests
	id ~ [b] --> Basic functionality tests
	id ~ [c] --> Complex functionality tests
	id ~ [d] --> Director VMOD tests
	id ~ [e] --> ESI tests
	id ~ [g] --> GZIP tests
	id ~ [j] --> JAIL tests
	id ~ [l] --> VSL tests
	id ~ [m] --> VMOD tests excluding director
	id ~ [p] --> Persistent tests
	id ~ [r] --> Regression tests, same number as ticket
	id ~ [s] --> Slow tests, expiry, grace etc.
	id ~ [t] --> sTreaming tests
	id ~ [v] --> VCL tests: execute VRT functions
