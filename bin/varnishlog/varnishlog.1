.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads and presents
.Xr varnishd 1
shared memory logs.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl a
When writing to a file, append to it rather than overwrite it.
.It Fl b
Include log entries which result from communication with a backend
server.
If neither
.Fl b
nor
.Fl c
is specified,
.Nm
acts as if they both were.
.It Fl C
Ignore case when matching regular expressions.
.It Fl c
Include log entries which result from communication with a client.
If neither
.Fl b
nor
.Fl c
is specified,
.Nm
acts as if they both were.
.It Fl D
Daemonize.
.It Fl d
Process old log entries on startup.
Normally,
.Nm
will only process entries which are written to the log after it
starts.
.It Fl I Ar regex
Include log entries which match the specified regular expression.
If neither
.Fl I
nor
.Fl i
is specified, all log entries are included.
.It Fl i Ar tag
Include log entries with the specified tag.
If neither
.Fl I
nor
.Fl i
is specified, all log entries are included.
.It Fl k Ar num
Only show the first
.Nm num
log records.
.It Fl n
Specifies the name of the
.Nm varnishd
instance to get logs from.
If
.Fl n
is not specified, the host name is used.
.It Fl o
Group log entries by request ID.
This has no effect when writing to a file using the
.Fl w
option.
.It Fl P Ar file
Write the process's PID to the specified
.Ar file .
.It Fl r Ar file
Read log entries from
.Ar file
instead of shared memory.
.It Fl s Ar num
Skip the first
.Ar num
log records.
.It Fl u
Unbuffered output.
.It Fl V
Display the version number and exit.
.It Fl w Ar file
Write log entries to
.Ar file
instead of displaying them.
The file will be overwritten unless the
.Fl a
option was specified.
.Pp
If
.Nm
receives a
.Dv SIGHUP
while writing to a file, it will reopen the file, allowing the old one
to be rotated away.
.It Fl X Ar regex
Exclude log entries which match the specified regular expression.
.It Fl x Ar tag
Exclude log entries with the specified tag.
.El
.Pp
If the
.Fl o
option was specified, an additional
.Ar tag
and
.Ar regex
may be specified to select only requests which generated a log entry
with the given
.Ar tag
whose contents match the given
.Ar regex .
.Sh TAGS

.Sh EXAMPLES
The following command line simply copies all log entries to a log
file:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
$ varnishlog -w /var/log/varnish.log
.Ed
.Pp
The following command line reads that same log file and displays
requests for the front page:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
$ varnishlog -r /var/log/varnish.log -c -o RxURL '^/$'
