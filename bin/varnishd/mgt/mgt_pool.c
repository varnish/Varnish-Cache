 *
 * We maintain a number of worker thread pools, to spread lock contention.
 *
 * Pools can be added on the fly, as a means to mitigate lock contention,
 * but can only be removed again by a restart. (XXX: we could fix that)
 *
 * Two threads herd the pools, one eliminates idle threads and aggregates
 * statistics for all the pools, the other thread creates new threads
 * on demand, subject to various numerical constraints.
 *
 * The algorithm for when to create threads needs to be reactive enough
 * to handle startup spikes, but sufficiently attenuated to not cause
 * thread pileups.  This remains subject for improvement.
