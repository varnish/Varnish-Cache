 *
 * This is the central switch-board for backend connections and it is
 * slightly complicated by a number of optimizations.
 *
 * The data structures:
 *
 *    A vrt_backend is a definition of a backend in a VCL program.
 *
 *    A backend is a TCP destination, possibly multi-homed and it has a
 *    number of associated properties and statistics.
 *
 *    A vbe_conn is an open TCP connection to a backend.
 *
 *    A bereq is a memory carrier for handling a HTTP transaction with
 *    a backend over a vbe_conn.
 *
 *    A director is a piece of code that selects which backend to use,
 *    by whatever method or metric it chooses.
 *
 * The relationships:
 *
 *    Backends and directors get instantiated when VCL's are loaded,
 *    and this always happen in the CLI thread.
 *
 *    When a VCL tries to instantiate a backend, any existing backend
 *    with the same identity (== definition in VCL) will be used instead
 *    so that vbe_conn's can be reused across VCL changes.
 *
 *    Directors disapper with the VCL that created them.
 *
 *    Backends disappear when their reference count drop to zero.
 *
 *    Backends have their host/port name looked up to addrinfo structures
 *    when they are instantiated, and we just cache that result and cycle
 *    through the entries (for multihomed backends) on failure only.
 *    XXX: add cli command to redo lookup.
 *
 *    bereq is sort of a step-child here, we just manage the pool of them.
