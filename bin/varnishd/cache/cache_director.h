 * Director APIs
 *
 * A director ("VDI") is an abstract entity which can either satisfy a
 * backend fetch request or select another director for the job.
 *
 * In theory a director does not have to talk HTTP over TCP, it can satisfy
 * the backend request using any means it wants, although this is presently
 * not implemented.
