 * Waiters are herders of connections:  They monitor a large number of
 * connections and react if data arrives, the connection is closed or
 * if nothing happens for a specified timeout period.
 *
 * The "poll" waiter should be portable to just about anything, but it
 * is not very efficient because it has to setup state on each call to
 * poll(2).  Almost all kernels have made better facilities for that
 * reason, needless to say, each with its own NIH-controlled API:
 *
 * - kqueue on FreeBSD
 * - epoll on Linux
 * - ports on Solaris
 *
 * Public interfaces
